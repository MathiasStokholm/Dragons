# 2770 Dungeons

A small experiment in creating a backend/frontend service for my Dungeons & Dragons group. 

Note: The backend only needs to be running when using the "Initiative" service.



## Backend

To run the backend service, navigate to the `backend` directory and install the needed requirements (assuming you already have Python and pip):

```bash
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then start the backend server by calling:

```bash
python run.py
```



### Frontend

To run the frontend service, navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the needed requirements (assuming you already have npm):

```bash
npm install
```

To start the frontend service is development mode (with hot realoading), run:

```bash
npm run start
```

To create a "production-ready" build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
